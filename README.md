# Analysis of Air Quality Index in Mexico City Metropolitan Area (CDMX) from 2019 to 2023

---

## Overview

This project analyzes the Air Quality Index (AQI) data for the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (CDMX) from 2019 to 2023. The data, provided by the Secretar√≠a del Medio Ambiente (SEDEMA), includes hourly AQI readings by zone and atmospheric pollutant according to the environmental standard NADF-009-AIRE-2017. The analysis involves data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical techniques to assess the air quality over the specified period.

## Dataset Overview and Dimensions of Variability

### Primary Variable
The primary variable in this dataset is the Air Quality Index (AQI) for different pollutants, which includes hourly measurements of AQI values for various atmospheric contaminants.

### Dimensions of Variability
1. **Contaminants**: The dataset includes AQI measurements for six different pollutants:
   - Ozone (O3)
   - Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)
   - Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
   - Carbon Monoxide (CO)
   - PM10 (particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less)
   - PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less)

2. **Locations**: Measurements are taken across five regions:
   - Noroeste (Northwest)
   - Noreste (Northeast)
   - Centro (Center)
   - Suroeste (Southwest)
   - Sureste (Southeast)

3. **Time**: The dataset spans from 2019 to 2023, with hourly AQI readings corresponding to specific dates and hours.

## Overview of the Project

### Data Loading and Preparation
1. **Loading Data**: CSV files from 2019 to 2022 are loaded into Pandas DataFrames, skipping the first eight rows to bypass metadata.
2. **Data Concatenation**: The data from all four years is concatenated into a single DataFrame.
3. **Datetime Column Creation**: A new datetime column is created by combining the 'Fecha' and 'Hora' columns.

### Data Analysis
1. **Ozono Centro Region Time Series**: A line graph is generated for the 'Ozono Centro' variable, visualizing the time series of ozone levels in the Centro region.

2. **Ozone Index Across Different Regions**: A single graph is created to plot the ozone index for different locations, with different colors representing different regions.

3. **AQI for Various Contaminants and Regions**: A multi-panel graph is generated, where each panel displays a different pollutant and the lines represent different regions.

### Data Imputation and Moving Averages
1. **Data Imputation**: Missing data for O3 in the southeast region is filled using linear interpolation.
2. **Moving Averages**: A 7-day moving average is applied to the time series using both uniform and triangular kernels, and the results are plotted.

### Moving Averages for Different Periods
1. **Rectangular Kernel Convolution**: Moving averages for 15 days, 1 month, and 3 months are computed using rectangular kernels and the `np.convolve` function.
2. **Plotting Convolutions**: The results of the convolutions for different pollutants and regions are visualized in multi-panel graphs.

### Generation of 4D Array for Moving Averages
1. **4D Array Creation**: A 4-dimensional array is generated to store moving averages for different periods. The dimensions represent time, pollutant, zone, and moving average length.
2. **Applying Convolutions**: Convolutions are applied to the dataset, and results are stored in the 4D array.
3. **Visualizing Results**: The results are visualized in figures showing the moving averages for different periods.
